# RISC-V-Simulator

Here we had developed an environment for the  RISC-V language. It is developed in the three phases and in each phase we have added new features. Following features are added in different phases.For each phase we have a GUI and a NON GUi version. 

# phase 1 

In this we had implemented the non piplined version of execution of the Risc-V Instruction. 

# Phase 2 

It has both piplined and non piplined version of execution of the instruction. 

# Phase 3 

With all the features of the Phase e2 and 1 It has also the implementation of the caches also. 


A detailed Guide for using it and desigin of the code has been given in each phase folder.
