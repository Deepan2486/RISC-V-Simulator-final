# RISC-V-Simulator

Here we had developed an environment for the  RISC-V language. It is developed in 3 phases and in each phase we have added new features. Following features are added in different phases. For each phase we have a GUI and a NON GUI version. 

# phase 1 

In this we have implemented the non-piplined version of execution of the RISC-V Instruction. 

# Phase 2 

It has both piplined and non-piplined version (with and without data forwarding) of execution of the instruction. 

# Phase 3 

Incorporation of data and instruction cache, on phase 2 code. 


A detailed Guide for using it and design of the code has been given in each phase folder (as separate README files. The design of each phase has been given as DESIGN files)
